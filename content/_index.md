Hi, I'm Meshak. I have great interest in the infrastructure side of IT, but like making/scripting things in general.

# Projects

My best projects are:

- [nopaper](https://github.com/meskuk/nopaper) - A Python script to monitor the status of HP LaserJet MFPs.
- [Ansible playbooks](https://github.com/meskuk/playbooks) - Ansible playbooks for personal use.
- [PowerShell Scripts](https://github.com/meskuk/scripts) - Simple scripts I made to help me explore Active Directory environments.

More can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/meskuk) profile.
