Hi, I'm Meshak. I'm looking for the next step in my career. I have proficiency with:

- Linux administration - especially RHEL-based systems as I use Fedora daily, and Debian
- Scripting - Python, Bash, and some PowerShell
- Networking - DNS, DHCP, VPNs (WireGuard), TCP/IP

In my spare time, I like to look at these exact concepts too, or stumble on flaws with people's applications. Both are fun. 

# Projects

My best projects are:

- [nopaper](https://github.com/meskuk/nopaper) - A Python script to monitor the status of HP LaserJet MFPs.
- [Ansible playbooks](https://github.com/meskuk/playbooks) - Ansible playbooks for personal use.
- [PowerShell Scripts](https://github.com/meskuk/scripts) - Simple scripts I made to help me explore Active Directory environments.

More can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/meskuk) profile.
